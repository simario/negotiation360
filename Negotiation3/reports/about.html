		<p style="margin: 20px;">Everyone negotiates. At work. In their communities. And even at home with their families. Negotiating effectively means reaching agreements that would slip through other people's fingers; creating value that others might overlook; and resolving small differences before they become costly disputes.</p>

		<p style="margin: 20px;">Successful negotiators are well-rounded. They rely on a range of analytic, interpersonal, and problem-solving skills. They approach their approach to the situation at hand and have the agility to deal with different bargaining styles. </p>

		<p style="margin: 20px;">To enhance your effectiveness as a negotiator, you need to recognize your strengths and weaknesses. <strong>Negotiation 360&deg;</strong> provides a personalized profile of the skills that you can build on and other areas where you can improve. It also highlights key negotiation concepts about creating value and engaging other parties.</p>
