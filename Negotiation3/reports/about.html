		<p style="margin: 20px;">Everyone negotiates. At work. In their communities. And even at home with their families. Negotiating well means:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>reaching agreements that might slip through most people's fingers</li>
			<li>creating value that others might overlook</li>
			<li>resolving small differences before they become costly disputes</li>
		</ul>

		<p style="margin: 20px;">Successful negotiators are well-rounded. They rely on complementary interpersonal, analytic, and problem-solving skills. They also are agile. They adjust their approach to the situation at hand and deal with different bargaining styles.</p>

		<p style="margin: 20px;">To enhance your own effectiveness as a negotiator, start by honestly assessing your current strengths and weaknesses. <strong>Negotiation 360&deg;</strong> provides a personalized profile of the skills that you can build on and other areas where you can improve. It also highlights key negotiation concepts about creating value and engaging other parties..</p>
