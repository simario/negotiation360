		<p style="margin: 20px;">Everyone negotiates. At work. In their communities. And even at home with their families. Negotiating well means:</p>

		<ul style="margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px;">
			<li>reaching agreements that might slip through most people's fingers</li>
			<li>crafting value-creating solutions</li>
			<li>resolving small differences before they become costly disputes</li>
		</ul>

		<p style="margin: 20px;">Successful negotiators are well-rounded. They rely on complementary interpersonal, analytic, and problem-solving skills. They also are agile. They adjust their approach to the situation at hand and can deal effectively with different bargaining styles.</p>

		<p style="margin: 20px;"><strong>Negotiation 360&deg;</strong> provides you with a personalized profile of your relational and problem-solving skills. It identifies skills that you can build on and other areas where you can improve. It also highlights key negotiation concepts about creating value and engaging other parties.</p>
