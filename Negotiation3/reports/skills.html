    You rated yourself <b>%@</b> compared to people you typically
    
    negotiate with. The reality is that it is hard to rate our overall effectiveness, for the same reasons
    
    that it's hard to judge our success in a particular transaction.
    
    After all, you usually know only your half of the story: did you leave some value on the table; did
    
    you stress an important relationship? The other side may not tell you, so there's plenty of room
    
    for self­doubt and worry. Good negotiators are often modest about their skills. That humility
    
    serves them well, as it prompts them to think through their strategy carefully. They also
    
    understand that even if they prepare carefully, they have to be agile, ready for surprises, pleasant
    
    and otherwise.
    </br>
    Ideally, we'd all like to outstanding at each of the four skills: asserting our interests,
    
    understanding others, creating value, and claiming our share. As we've already seen, each
    
    presents a dilemma or tradeoff. Being more open, for example, may invite either a cooperative
    
    response or exploitation, depending on whom we're dealing with. Likewise, firmly asserting our
    
    interests may win us a larger share, but if the other party digs in, creativity may be hampered.

    The resource page lists some excellent books on negotiation strategy and tactics, as well as
    
    websites with up­to­date materials. Here's a quick summary of important concepts and
    
    techniques for expanding your skills in each direction.

    <ul>
        
        <li> Inquire. Without realizing it, many negotiators fail to test their assumptions about the
            
            other parties needs and perceptions.</li>
        
        <li> Listen deeply. Don't prejudge. Be alert for ideas you can build on.</li>
        
        <li> Consult your own feelings. If you are feeling anxious, maybe they are, too.</li>
        
        <li> "Go to the balcony." Follow Bill Ury's advice and try to view your interaction as if you were
            
            a member of the audience, sitting way back, taking everything in.
            
            Assert your interests</li>
        
        <li> Build up your BATNA (your walkaway option if there's no deal). The more confident you
            
            are about your alternatives, the more secure you'll be negotiating.</li>
        
        <li> Focus on their BATNA (their no­deal alternative). Just because you need them doesn't
            
            mean that they don't need you.</li>
        
        <li> Practice in low­stakes situations. Try to be more assertive in situations where it doesn't
            
            really matter if you come to agreement.</li>
        
        <li> Don't oversell. Research shows that people in weaker positions tend to talk too much. </li>
    </ul>
    <img src="piechart.png" width='28' hieght='24'/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Maximize your share</b>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Don't get "anchored." Work from your number. Not theirs.</li>
        
        <li> Watch the clock. If the other party is under a deadline, use that to your advantage.</li>
        
        <li> Try "post­settlement settlement." After reaching a firm agreement, suggest that you
            
            review the terms to see if adjusting the terms might help both parties.</li>
        
        <li> Avoid the winner's curse. You may wonder if you could have gotten more. The only way 
            
            to know for sure is to demand too much and blow up the deal.</li>
        
        Create value
        
        <li> Negotiate how you negotiate. </li>
        
        <li> Use your interpersonal skills to build trust.</li>
        
        <li> Make mutually beneficial trades by identifying differences in valuation, expectations, and 
            
            attitudes toward risk.</li>
        
        <li> Don't play the wrong game. It's hard to haggle and be creative at the same time.</li>
