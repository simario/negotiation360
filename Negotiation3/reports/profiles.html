		    <div id="clusterGraph" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; width: 280px; height: 200px"></div>
			<p>We used statistical tools to see how negotiators who have taken this test cluster, according to their own perceived strengths and weaknesses. In order to make group comparisons, we "normalized" the data. That is, we compared each person's response to the average we received in our pre-launch survey.</p>
			<p>We found five basic types. Some people were strongly identified with a particular type, while others were close to the boundary between one group and another.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="dragend-page">
		    <div id="empatheticValueCreators" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; width: 280px; height: 200px"></div>
			<p>Pictured here are <strong>Empathetic value creators</strong>. They have above average confidence about understanding the true needs of their counterparts. And likely as a result, they believe they are more likely to spot problem-solving opportunities. But on the other hand, they have below average confidence when it comes to asserting their own interests and maximizing their share of the resulting value.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="dragend-page">
		    <div id="assertiveValueClaimers" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; width: 280px; height: 200px"></div>
			<p>By contrast, other people who are more confident about self-advocacy may be capture a larger slice of the pie (though there may be less total value to win). The profile of <strong>Assertive value claimers</strong> is shown here. It's the mirror image of the Empathetic value creators, in that they are more confident about their skill in advocating for themselves, but less sure about their ability to relate to others.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="middle dragend-page">
		    <div id="assertiveValueCreators" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; width: 280px; height: 200px"></div>
			<p>Other people-<strong>Assertive value creators</strong>-are just as confident about their ability to advocate for themselves are Assertive value claimers, but less so about the value they obtain. Their profile is shown here. In reality some of them may perform very well, but as psychological "maximizers," no matter how much they get, they tend worry that they should have claimed an even a bigger share of the pie.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="dragend-page">
		    <div id="relationalNegotiatiors" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; width: 280px; height: 200px"></div>
			<p>Some others who have taken this test have rated themselves high on both ends of the interpersonal scale. The profile of <strong>Relational negotiators</strong> is shown here. That self-assessments may be accurate, though it raises the question of why, given superior relational skills, they don't do better at creating and claiming value.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="last dragend-page">
		    <div id="outcomeFocusedNegotiatiors" style="margin: 30px auto 10px; width: 280px; height: 200px"></div>
			<p>In turn, still other people rate themselves high on both ends of the outcome scale. This is the profile of <strong>Outcome-focused negotiators</strong>. It may be accurate, as well, though it raises a question of whether it's easy to attain good results with relational skills that are not as strong.</p>
