But note that people tend to be most confident about their ability to understand the needs and feelings of other people. By contrast, many worry about underperformance when it comes to results.</p>

	<div>
		<p style="margin: 20px;">There is nothing basically good or bad if your scores match those averages. (Relatively few people have an exact match.)  In your experience, do you think other negotiators accurately assess their strengths and weaknesses? For example:</p> 

		<ul style="margin: 20px 20px 20px 0px;">
			<li>Do most people you deal with actually get inferior results?</li>
			<li>Is the strength of most negotiators you know actually is their ability to understand others? </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p style="margin: 20px;">The fact is that our self-perceptions do not always match reality. Even so, those beliefs still influence behavior, especially when it comes to interacting with others. </p>
