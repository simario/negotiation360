But note that people tend to be most confident about their ability to understand the needs and feelings of other people. By contrast, they worry about underperformance when it comes to results.</p> 
	<div>
		
	<div>
		<p style="margin: 20px;">There is nothing basically good or bad if your scores match those averages. (Relatively few people have an exact match.) In any case, give some thought about whether you think other people's self-assessment about their negotiation strengths and weaknesses is accurate.</p>

		<p style="margin: 20px;">Do most people you deal with actually get inferior results? Is the strength of most negotiators you know actually is their ability to understand others? Peoples' self- perceptions may not match reality, but they still influence their behavior, especially when it comes to interacting with others.</p>

				After considering those questions, you may want to adjust the ratings you just gave yourself. That's fine. You can do the test over again. But first take a look at the profile generated by those responses.
